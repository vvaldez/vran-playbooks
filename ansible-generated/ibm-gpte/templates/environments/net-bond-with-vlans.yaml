# This template configures each role to use a pair of bonded nics (nic2 and
# nic3) and configures an IP address on each relevant isolated network
# for each role. This template assumes use of network-isolation.yaml.
#
# FIXME: if/when we add functionality to heatclient to include heat
# environment files we should think about using it here to automatically
# include network-isolation.yaml.
